  <p class="atom">
The atoms of every element are held together by the bonding action of valence electrons. This
bonding is due to the fact that it is the tendency of each atom to complete its last orbit by acquiring 8
electrons in it. However, in most of the substances, the last orbit is incomplete i.e. the last orbit does
not have 8 electrons. This makes the atom active to enter into bargain with other atoms to acquire 8
electrons in the last orbit. To do so, the atom may lose, gain or share valence electrons with other
atoms. In semiconductors, bonds are formed by sharing of valence electrons. Such bonds are called
co-valent bonds
